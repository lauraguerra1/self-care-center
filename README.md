# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- This web application allows users to login to a self care center, where they will be met with a personalized welcome message. Users are prompted with a choice of which message they would like to receive, a mantra or an affirmation. Once the user has selected an option, they will see a message of that type appear on the screen. Users are never shown the same message twice, until they have seen all the messages of that specific type (mantra or affirmation) the application has to offer, at which point they will be shown a notification that lets them know they will now begin seeing repeated mantras or affirmations. 
- Mental health is of utmost importance to human functionality as a happy and healthy contributor to society. Negative self talk impacts us all, and according to the National Science Foundation's research, as referenced by Professor Fran Simone, Ph.D., in her blog post on [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/family-affair/201712/negative-self-talk-dont-let-it-overwhelm-you), approximately 80% of our daily self-talk is negative. Among her suggestions for breaking the habit of negatove self talk is *practicing positive self talk*. This web application aims to contribute to a solution for negative self talk by providing users with affirmations and mantras which they can use to contribute to their own personal practice of positive self talk.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
Mod 1, Week 3
A total of 6-8 hours was spent on this project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
 
- Match a provided comp using HTML and CSS
- Listen and respond to user events
- Provide user-friendly error messages and notifications. 
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
##### Challenges: 
- Applying the proper spacing to the radio buttons (the choice between an affirmation and a mantra) was a particular challenge at the beginning of this project. Initially, HTML `spans` were used to make the elements inline and provide margins to them in CSS. After gaining an understanding, this particular challenge transitioned to a win, highlighted below. 

##### Wins: 
- The successful application of `flexbox` to space the radio buttons was a win during the completion of this project, as flexbox was a newly learned concept at this week of the Turing curriculum.
- During this project, there was an option to choose your own adventure in terms of what functinality to add to the web application after completing the minimal viable product. Complwtion of two `CYOA`'s was a win in this project.
